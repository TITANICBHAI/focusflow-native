/**
 * NuclearModeModule — Old Architecture (NativeModules bridge)
 *
 * "Nuclear Mode" lets a committed user permanently uninstall their most
 * addictive apps (Instagram, TikTok, etc.) directly from FocusFlow.
 * Each call launches the system uninstall dialog; the user must confirm
 * in the OS dialog, so there is no risk of accidental deletion.
 *
 * Kotlin: android-native/app/.../modules/NuclearModeModule.kt
 * Registered via: FocusDayPackage → createNativeModules()
 *
 * Permission required: android.permission.REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES
 * (patched into AndroidManifest.xml by install.sh)
 *
 * Methods:
 *   requestUninstallApp(packageName)   → Promise<void>
 *     Opens the system "Uninstall <App>?" dialog for a single package.
 *     Resolves immediately after the dialog is shown — resolution does NOT
 *     mean the app was uninstalled; the user still has to confirm in the OS UI.
 *
 *   requestUninstallApps(packages)     → Promise<void>
 *     Opens uninstall dialogs for each package sequentially with a 500 ms gap
 *     so the system has time to process each one.
 *
 *   isAppInstalled(packageName)        → Promise<boolean>
 *     Returns true if the given package is currently installed on the device.
 *     Use this to filter the Nuclear Mode selection list before showing it.
